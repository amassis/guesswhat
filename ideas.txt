- Store characteristics as an array for each type
- store characteristics "true" for each element of that type.
- For every question, narrow down - filtering the elements that match.
- When there is one match, take a guess.
- If not right, enter a new element, and request a new characteristic. (Gen AI could tell an additional characteristic for that type that identifies the element?)

- Implement messages in the Error Controler to handle all errors with appropriate error messages, even the operational ones that could be caught elsewhere.
- Implement a home page for language selection
- Implement language as a property of type.
